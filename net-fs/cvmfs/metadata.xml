  The CernVM File System is a client-server file system developed to
  deliver software stacks onto virtual machines in a fast, scalable,
  and reliable way. CernVM-FS is implemented as a FUSE module. It
  makes a specially prepared directory tree stored on a web server
  look like a local read-only file system on the virtual
  machine. CernVM-FS uses outgoing HTTP connections only, thereby it
  avoids most of the firewall issues of other network file systems. It
  transfers data file by file on demand, verifying the content by
  SHA-1 keys.
