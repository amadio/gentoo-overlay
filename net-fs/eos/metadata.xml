  EOS is a software solution that aims to provide fast and reliable multi-PB
  disk-only storage technology for both LHC and non-LHC use-cases at CERN. The
  core of the implementation is the XRootD framework which provides feature-rich
  remote access protocol. The storage system is running on commodity hardware
  with disks in JBOD configuration. It is written mostly in C/C++, with some of
  the extra modules in Python. Files can be accessed via native XRootD protocol,
  a POSIX-like FUSE client or HTTP(S) and WebDav protocol.
