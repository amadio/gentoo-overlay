  <longdescription lang="en">
    Dask is a simple task scheduling system that uses directed acyclic
    graphs (DAGs) of tasks to break up large computations into many
    small ones. Dask-expr is Dask DataFrames with query optimization.
    This is a rewrite of Dask DataFrame that includes query optimization
    and generally improved organization.
