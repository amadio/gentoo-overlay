  Comic Neue was launched in rough form on the 7th of April 2014. A month later
  it was launched as a Kickstarter project to fund expanding the font to support
  more than 40 languages. Technical aspects of the font were also greatly
  improved thanks to Hrant Papazian, owner of The MicroFoundry. The project was
  successfully funded on 13 June 2014.
